Bin Huang is an electrical engineer and data scientist who's bringing some serious AI magic to power grids. Think of him as the electrician of the future—except instead of just fixing wires, he's making them think. From turning raw data into insights that make the grid run smoother than a well-oiled machine, to optimizing power systems like he's playing a high-stakes video game, Bin is all about pushing the limits. He loves nothing more than using cutting-edge tech to keep the lights on, make power grids unbreakable, and have some fun while he's at it.
